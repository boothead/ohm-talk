# MVC in Haskell

> Use the mvc library to distill concurrent programs into pure and single-threaded programs using the Model-View-Controller pattern. 
> This transformation lets you:

* replay your program deterministically,
* do property-based testing of your model (like QuickCheck), and:
* equationally reason about your pure core.
